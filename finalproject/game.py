class Game():
    '''General Definition
    A game consists of rolling of one or more similar dice (Die objects)
        one or more times.
    By similar dice, we mean that each die in a given game 
        has the same number of sides and associated faces, 
        but each die object may have its own weights.
    Each game is initialized with a Python list 
        that contains one or more dice.
    Game objects have a behavior to play a game, 
        i.e. to roll all of the dice a given number of times.
    Game objects only keep the results of their most recent play.
    Specific Methods and Attributes;
        1. An initializer
        2. A play method
        3. Show results of the most recent play

            to a private data frame.
        The data frame should be in wide format, 
            i.e. have the roll number as a named index, 
            columns for each die number 
            (using its list index as the column name),
            and the face rolled in that instance in each cell.
