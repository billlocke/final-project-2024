DS5100 Final Project Repo

Metadata:

Author: Bill Locke
Project: The module is 'finalproject' (a simple Monte Carlo simulator)
using a set of 3 related classes:
    1. Die class 
    2. Game class
    3. Analyzer class
    
The classes are related in the following way: 
    Game objects are initialized with a Die object, 
    and Analyzer objects are initialized with a Game object.

        [Die] ‚Üí [Game] ‚Üí [Analyzer]

In this simulator, a ‚Äúdie‚Äù can be any discrete random variable 
associated with astochastic process, such as using a deck of cards, 
flipping a coin, rolling an actual die, or speaking a language.

Synopsis: 

Show brief demo code of how the classes are used, i.e. code snippets
showing how to install, import, and use the code to (1) create dice, 
(2) play a game, and (3) analyze a game. 
You can use preformatted blocks for the code.

Import modules as follows:

    import numpy as np
    import pandas as pd
    import unittest
    import finalproject
    from die import Die
    from game import Game
    from anlyzer import Analyzer


(1) create dice
faces = np.arange (6)  # creates array
faces_df = Die(faces)

faces_df.change_weight (4, 5)

die = faces_df.create_die (faces_df)    # create die with updated weights

die_deep2 = faces_df.show_die_state (die)  # show die state

results = faces_df.roll_die(1000)   # roll die

results.value_counts()   # tally roll results

faces_df.plot_results (results)   # plot roll results

(2) play a game

faces = np.arange (6)  # creates array
faces_df1 = Die(faces) # instantiate Game objects
faces_df2 = Die(faces)

faces_df1.change_weight (4, 5)

die1 = faces_df1.create_die (faces_df1)  # create die
die2 = faces_df2.create_die (faces_df2)

die_deep1 = faces_df1.show_die_state (die1)
die_deep2 = faces_df2.show_die_state (die2)

die_list = [die1, die2]

n_rolls = 10

results1 = faces_df1.roll_die(n_rolls)
print ('results1:', results1)
faces_df1.plot_results (results1)

results1 = die1.play(n_rolls)
faces_df1.plot_results (results1)

results2 = faces_df2.roll_die(n_rolls)
faces_df2.plot_results (results2)

results_df = pd.DataFrame()
results1 = faces_df1.roll_die(n_rolls)
results_df = results_df.concat ([results1])

(3) analyze a game

Help on class Die in module __main__:

class Die(builtins.object)
 |  Die(faces)
 |  
 |  General Definition
 |  A die has ùëÅ sides, or ‚Äúfaces‚Äù, and ùëä weights,
 |  and can be rolled to select a face.
 |  For example, a ‚Äúdie‚Äù with ùëÅ=2 is a coin, and
 |  a one with ùëÅ=6 is a standard die.
 |  Normally, dice and coins are ‚Äúfair,‚Äù meaning that the
 |  each side has an equal weight.
 |  An unfair die is one where the weights are unequal.
 |  Each side contains a unique symbol.
 |  Symbols may be all alphabetic or all numeric.
 |  ùëä defaults to 1.0 for each face
 |  but can be changed after the object is created.
 |  The weights are just positive numbers (integers or floats, including 0),
 |  not a normalized probability distribution.
 |  The die has one behavior, which is to be rolled one or more times.
 |  Specific Methods and Attributes:
 |      1. An initializer
 |      2. Change the weight of a single side.
 |      3. Create die
 |      4. Roll die
 |      5. Show die's current state
 |  
 |  Methods defined here:
 |  
 |  __init__(self, faces)
 |      Initialize self.  See help(type(self)) for accurate signature.
 |  
 |  change_weight(self, face_to_change, new_weight)
 |      Takes two arguments: the face value to be changed and the new weight.
 |  
 |  create_die(self, faces_df)
 |      Create the die using the object's weights. Save to self as a DataFrame.
 |  
 |  plot_results(self, my_results)
 |      Show the results of rolling the dice n times with a simple bar graph.
 |  
 |  roll_die(self, number_of_rolls)
 |      takes a parameter of how many times the die is to be rolled; defaults to 1.
 |  
 |  show_die_state(self, die)
 |      A method to show the die‚Äôs current state.
 |      Returns a copy of the private die data frame.
 |  
 |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 |  Data descriptors defined here:
 |  
 |  __dict__
 |      dictionary for instance variables (if defined)
 |  
 |  __weakref__
 |      list of weak references to the object (if defined)


Help on class Game in module __main__:

class Game(builtins.object)
 |  Game(die_list)
 |  
 |  General Definition
 |  A game consists of rolling of one or more similar dice (Die objects)
 |      one or more times.
 |  By similar dice, we mean that each die in a given game 
 |      has the same number of sides and associated faces, 
 |      but each die object may have its own weights.
 |  Each game is initialized with a Python list 
 |      that contains one or more dice.
 |  Game objects have a behavior to play a game, 
 |      i.e. to roll all of the dice a given number of times.
 |  Game objects only keep the results of their most recent play.
 |  Specific Methods and Attributes;
 |      1. An initializer
 |      2. A play method
 |      3. Show results of the most recent play
 |  
 |  Methods defined here:
 |  
 |  __init__(self, die_list)
 |      Initialize self.  See help(type(self)) for accurate signature.
 |  
 |  play(self, number_of_rolls)
 |      Takes parameter specifying how many times 
 |          the dice should be rolled. Saves result of the play
 |          to a private data frame.
 |      The data frame should be in wide format, 
 |          i.e. have the roll number as a named index, 
 |          columns for each die number 
 |          (using its list index as the column name),
 |          and the face rolled in that instance in each cell.
 |  
 |  show_game_results(self, my_results)
 |      Show the results of rolling the dice n times with a simple bar graph.
 |  
 |  show_results(self, form='w')
 |      Takes parameter specifying wide or narrow format. 
 |      Returns a copy of the private play data frame
 |          to the user.
 |      Takes a parameter to return the data frame 
 |          in narrow or wide form which defaults to wide form.
 |      The narrow form will have a MultiIndex, 
 |          comprising the roll number and the dienumber (in that order), 
 |          and a single column with the outcomes (i.e. the face rolled).
 |

 |  Data descriptors defined here:

 |  __weakref__
 |      list of weak references to the object (if defined)

Help on class Analyzer in module __main__:

class Analyzer(builtins.object)
 |  Analyzer(die_list)
 |  
 |  General Definition
 |  An Analyzer object takes the results of a single game and 
 |  computes various descriptive statistical properties about it.
 |  Specific Methods and Attributes:
 |      1. An initializer
 |      2. Jackpot
 |      3. Face counts per roll
 |      4. Combo_count
 |      5. Permutation count
 |  
 |  Methods defined here:
 |  
 |  __init__(self, die_list)
 |      Takes a game object as its input parameter.
 |      Throws a ValueError if the passed value is not a Game object
 |  
 |  combo_count(self)
 |      Computes the distinct combinations of faces rolled,
 |          along with their counts.
 |      Combinations are order-independent and may contain repetitions.
 |      Returns a data frame of results.
 |      The data frame should have a MultiIndex of distinct combinations
 |          and a column for the associated counts.
 |  
 |  face_counts_per_roll(self, form='w')
 |      Computes how many times a given face is rolled in each event.
 |      For example, if a roll of five dice has all sixes, 
 |          then the counts for this roll would be 
 |          for the face value ‚Äò6‚Äô and for the other faces.
 |      Returns a data frame of results.
 |      The data frame has an index of the roll number,
 |          face values as columns, 
 |          and count values in the cells (i.e. it is in wide format).
 |  
 |  jackpot(self, number_of_rolls)
 |      A jackpot is a result in which all faces are the same,
 |          e.g. all ones for a six-sided die.
 |      Computes how many times the game resulted in a jackpot.
 |      Returns an integer for the number of jackpots.
 |  
 |  permutation_count(self)
 |      Computes the distinct permutations of faces rolled, a
 |          long with their counts.
 |      Permutations are order-dependent and may contain repetitions.
 |      Returns a data frame of results.
 |      The data frame should have a MultiIndex of distinct permutations
 |      and a column for the associated counts.
 |

 |  Data descriptors defined here:
 |  
 |  __dict__
 |      dictionary for instance variables (if defined)
